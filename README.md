# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## 1️⃣ Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict passenger survival using the Kaggle Titanic dataset.  
The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

Models Used:
- Logistic Regression (Accuracy: ~81%)
- Random Forest (Accuracy: ~80%)

Key Insight:
Fare, Sex, and Age were the most important features influencing survival.
